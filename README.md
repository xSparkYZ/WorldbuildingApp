# Worldbuilder App
Name to be determined<br/>
<br/>
## Introduction
I started learning coding, specifically **Java**, 10 months ago, and my first project is a personal application to assist me in my secondary hobby, which is writing.<br/>
<br/>
While still barebones, it will include a workspace to write in with formatting capabilities, as well as the ability to save attributes such as characters, countries, backstories, and more.<br/>

## Goal
The goal of this project is to provide a free alternative to the numerous paid world-building programs already available and to showcase to the world what I am capable of after completing my Java course in late 2025.<br/>

## Features (all of which are WIP)
- Writing workspace with formatting options
- Save/Load chapters and projects
- Create, save, and arrange attributes (characters, countries, cities, backstories, etc.) 

## Launch
Work in progress

## Sources
This app is inspired by other world-building apps, such as WorldAnvil and Campfire.
